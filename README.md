# ESX_AntiCombatlog v.0.7.1

Got fed up with turds combatlogging 24/7 on my RP Server.

Features:  
1. Kills combatloggers right on playerloaded and keeps them dead until the configurable penalty is over.  

How to install:
1. Copy to resources/[esx]
2. Add to start
3. Configure penalty

No sql due to performance concerns, so combatloggers can rejoin after restarts.
